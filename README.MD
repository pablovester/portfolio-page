<h1>Portfolio Page</h1>

In freeCodeCamp, I was tasked to create a portfolio page to put my front-end knowledge so far to a test. It contains a tiny "ABOUT" section, "PORTFOLIO" thumbnails with no ref links, "CONTACT" and a "SOCIAL" footer. I created this fictional portfolio page, using **Bootstrap 4, HTML5 and CSS3**. It contains a collapsable navbar with items that link to the sections of the website.
